# alert-logic

A Clojure library designed to demonstrate a basic API implementation. Uses an atom as a fake database and has several
endpoints for add/deleting/listing and getting data, all can be used via CURL or through the swagger UI.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have https://leiningen.org/ and at least Java version 11 installed.
2. From the root of the project type `lein ring server`.
3. This should lunch a local webserver running on port 3000 (i.e. http://localhost:3000/)
4. Going to the above URL should display a swagger UI page with details about the various endpoints that can be used,
 just click "Try it out" to give it a go.
